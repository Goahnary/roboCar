# robocar
This project is for Noah, Tyler, Taylor, and Jubal's RC car for our CS496 class.

## Running the car
To run the car, on the raspberry pi run the car.py script in a screen (or other similar program). The car will begin communication with the [roboRelay](https://github.com/Goahnary/roboRelay). 

For the video stream, you will also need to run the stream.py. This will start sending images to the Go streaming server.
